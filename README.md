# strloop2013

This project contains a single clojure source file, core.clj, which is an annotated version of the live coding session I gave at StrangeLoop 2013. It is meant to be executed step by step with an environment that allows single line evaluation.

## Slides

The slides related to the presentation can be found inside the Strangeloop repo:
